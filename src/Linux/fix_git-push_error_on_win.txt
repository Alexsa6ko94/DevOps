Error with pushing to git repo from windows host
Error: fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Invalid argument
================================================================================

Fix:
1, go to your local git project directory, open ".git/config" file and delete the "[remote "origin"]" section.
2, go to git bash and input "git remote add origin https://{username}:{password}@github.com/{username}/project.git"
3, input git push to check if it works.
